# boston_data
This JavaScript code imports the employee data from boston.js and stores it in the variable newboston.It then sorts the employee data in descending order of salary using a nested for loop.
The code then displays the top 5 employees and the employees earning more than 200000 per year on a web page.To do this, the code uses the document.getElementById() function to get the HTML elements with the IDs app and income.The code then uses the innerHTML property of these elements to set their content to the names and salaries of the top 5 employees and the employees earning more than 200000 per year.
